# linked-lists

This repository, part of The Odin Project's Node.js curriculum, showcases my implementations of singly and doubly linked lists in JavaScript, emphasizing the core concepts of linked list data structures.

## Learning Outcomes

Working on this project deepened my understanding of:

- **Node-based data structures:** Gained practical skills in creating and managing nodes.
- **Pointer management:** Learned how to effectively handle `next` and `prev` pointers in lists, ensuring data structure integrity.
- **List operations:** Developed a comprehensive understanding of common list operations, including insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## node.js

The `node.js` module is an Object factory crucial for node creation in linked lists. It features:

- Flexible node creation with `next` and optional `prev` pointers.
- Data management methods: `addData`, `removeData`, `getData`, and more.

## singlyLinkedList.js & doublyLinkedList.js

These files implement singly and doubly linked lists, respectively. Key features include:

- Core list functionalities: `append`, `prepend`, `insertAt`, `removeAt`, etc.
- Enhanced traversal in `doublyLinkedList.js` using `getNode` for efficient access.

## To Be Implemented

- **Circular Singly Linked List**
- **Circular Doubly Linked List**
